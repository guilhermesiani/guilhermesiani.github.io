Just try thinking about how much time we spend looking for an ideal tool to taking our notes, reminders, scheduling, sketching… A tool that give us freedom and flexibility to do everything we need. Yeah... so try looking around. Can you see this tool? There it is! A simple paper and pencil right next to you.

I can’t imagine how much ideas and time I saved using this and I will try explain why this works so well to me.

In all my programmer life I’ve tried to use many tools that could improve my capabilities to remember things, organize to do lists, improve creativity, etc. One thing that worked so well on all my needs giving me freedom, and combining all other tools that have separated and specialized functions, is paper and pencil.

I can’t imagine how many ideas and how much time I've saved using just this tool, and I will try explain why this works so well to me.

> Ok, Guilherme. But what about smartphone screen notifications for your schedule todo list/meeting?

Ok. I know and I use this too as an extra (Yeah.. as an extra, not as the main tool)

Organizing into paper or a notebook turns me more disciplined ever, just because I can create mindsets, draw ever I need to explore more and when I must remember some topics with emfhasis. This kind of things enforces our memory so well that tecnologies will never do the same.

Although tecnologies has credits about much other things and we are programmers because of this. I could’n abandon paper and freedom.

I did many class diagrams, flowcharts and database modeling that saved me much time rather start coding too fast, without thinking better what I really could do.

This experience demonstrate that this action save me much more time than if I had coded first and thinking how to solve my problem or applying some design patterns simultaneos. It is right that easier things we just code directly. Trying to draft this on paper will cost more time that codefying and that’s fine.

Try it and tell me later about your experience.

### Bullet Journal

Another big change that I did on my life organization methods is the use of Bullet Journal and I recomMend you to know about it a bit.

Bullet Journal helps me bringing my thoughts closer. For a long time I don't feel what is do something more ~~horrible~~ artistic and handmade. Even if simplistic, all that I said above abou paper and pencil is more powerful using Bullet Journal (In this case I use a pen :p).

I put on this notebook my year journey. Every month, every single day, all my notes, todo lists and reminders in one place is a kind of freedom that no app gave me.


Don’t stick to the stereotype that programmers should consume all possible technology.

I hope this experience I shared at least make you reflect.
