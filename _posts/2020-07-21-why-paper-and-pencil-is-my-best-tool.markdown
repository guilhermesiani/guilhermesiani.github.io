Try to think about how much time we spend looking for a ideal tool to taking our notes, reminders, scheduling, sketching... A tool that give us freedom and flexibility to do everthing we need.
Yeah.. so try to look on your side. Can you see this tool? Exactly! A simple paper and a pencil right next to you.

I can't imagine how much ideas and time I saved unsing this and I will try to explain why this works so well to me.

All my programmer's life I've tried to use many tools that improve my capabilities to remember things, organize TODO lists, improve criativity and etc.
But one thing that works so well on all my needs, with freedom and combined all that other tools have separated and especialized functions is paper and pencil.

> Ok, Guilherme. But what about reminders notification for your schedule todo/meeting on your smartphone?

Ok. I know and I use this too as a plus (Yeah.. as a plus, not the main tool)

And I say. Organizing into paper or a notebook turns me more disciplined ever, just because I can create mindsets or draw ever I need to explore more or must remember some topics with emfhasis. This kind of things enforces our memory habilities so well that tecnologies will never do.

Although tecnologies has credits about much other things and we are programmers because of this. I could'n abandon paper, I couln'd abondon freedom to put what I need as I want so fast and ready to use on my desk.

I realized many class diagrams, flowcharts and database modeling that saved me much time rather start coding too fast, without thinking better what I really want to do.

This experience demonstrate this action save me much time than if I had coded first and thinking how to solve my problem or apply some design simultaneos. Is it right that easier things we could code directly. Try to draft this will cost much time that code and that's fine.

Try it and tell me later about your experience.

### Bullet Journal

Another big change that I did on my life organization methods is the use of Bullet Journal and I recomend you to look a bit for it.

Bullet Journal helps me brings my thoughts closer. Much time ago I don't feel what is doing something ~~horrible~~ artistic and handmade. Even if simplistic, all that I say above about simple paper and pencil is more powerful using Bullet Journal (In this case I use a pen :p).

I put on this notebook all my year journey. Every month, every single day, all my notes, todo lists and reminders in one place is a kind of freedom
that any app gives me.

Don't stick to the stereotype that programmers should consume all possible tecnology.

I hope this experience I shared at least make you reflect.
