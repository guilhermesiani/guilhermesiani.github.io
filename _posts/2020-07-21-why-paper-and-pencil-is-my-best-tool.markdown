Try to think about how much time we spend looking for a ideal tool. A tool that give us freedom and flexibility to do everthing we need.
Yeah.. so try to look on you side. Can you see this tool? Exactly! A simple papel and a pencil right next to you.

I can't imagine how much ideas and time saved unsing this and I will try to explain why this works so good to me.

All my programmer life I tried to use many tools that improve my capabilities to remember things, organize TODO lists, improve criativity and etc.
But one thing that works very well with all my needs, with freedom and combined all that other tools have separated and especialized is Paper and pencil.

> Ok, Guilherme. But what about reminders notification for your schedule todo/meeting?

And I say. Organizing into paper or a notebook turns me more organized ever, just because I can create mindsets or draw ever I need to explore more or must remember some topics with emfhasis. This kind of things enforces our memory habilities so well that tecnologies will never do.

Although tecnologias has credits about much other things and we are programmers because of this, I could'n abandon paper, I couln'd abondon freedom to put what I need as I want.

By much time I used to create drafts classes and databases diagrams, logical flows and checklists before developing on computer. My experience demonstrate that this
action save me much time than if I had coded first and thinking how to do simultaneos. Is it right that easier things we could code directly. Try to draft this will cost much time that code and that's fine.

Try it and tell me later about your experience.

### Bullet Journal

Another big change that I did on my life organization methods is the use of Bullet Journal.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
